# Hashi

This project is a prototype to process a simple image and plot dots instead of
image to generate a structure to produce some hashi art.

I'm collecting chopsticks and I have hundreds of them now. I'd like to get an
image and make holes to attach them.

## Installation

    $ git clone git@github.com:jonatas/hashi.git

## Usage

    $ cd hashi
    $ bin/hashi-dots image.jpg

It will generate another `image-dots.jpg` and will replace all not white pixels
with black circles depending on the parameters you use. The default circle ratio
is 10 and the padding is 30.

    $ bin/hashi-dots image.jpg 5 25

## Development

This is a experimental project. Do not loose your time here. I don't have specs
and it's just a prototype.
